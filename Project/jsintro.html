            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction to JS(Java-Script)</h2>

            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
            <br><br>
            1.&nbsp;Client-side: <br> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others. <br><br>
2.&nbsp;Server-side: <br> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js. <br><br>
3.&nbsp;Imperative language: <br> In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call. <br><br>
4.&nbsp;Declarative programming: <br>  In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do. <br><br>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</h3>

1.&nbsp;Internal JS: <br> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the script tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag according to the requirement.
    <br><br>
2.&nbsp;External JS: <br> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension.js and then link this file inside the head tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
<br><br>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Features of JavaScript:</h3>

According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. 
With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript:<br><br>
1.&nbsp;JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made. <br>
2.&nbsp;Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions. <br>
3.&nbsp;Can handle date and time. <br>
4.&nbsp;Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML. <br>
5.&nbsp;No compiler is needed.
